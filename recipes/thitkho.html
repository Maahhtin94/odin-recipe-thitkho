        <li> 1 tbsp soy sauce </li>
        <li> 1 tbsp brown sugar </li>
        <li> 1 tbsp granulated sugar </li>
        <li> 2 tbsp vegetable oil </li>

    <h4> Instructions! </h4>
        <ol>
            <li> Prepare pork belly or shoulder. Give your pork a rinse under cold water. Then, using a sharp knife, slice pork into equal bite sized pieces with skin, fat, and meat attached, approx. 1-1/2 x 1 inch. </li>
            <li> In a large pot, add pork and enough water to cover the top. Bring water to a boil ~10 mins in order to remove impurities. </li>
            <li> Once boiling, removed pork belly from water and rinse once more until clear.
            <li> Next, marinate pork belly in a medium bowel with fish sauce, chicken bouillon, brown sugar, ground pepper, garlic, and shallots. Let this marinate for atleast 30 mins.</li>
            <li> While the pork is marinating, start by boiling your eggs for 10 minutes. Once cooked, tranfer eggs into a bowl of ice water to cool. When cooled, peel your eggs.</li>
            <li> Once pork belly has had enough time to marinate and absorb the flavors of the seasonings, prepare your large pot again</li>
            <li> In your large pot, start by adding your vegetable oil and granulated sugar. Bring your flame up in order to begin the caramelizing process </li>
            <li"> Caramelize your sugar until you achieve a dark brown caramel color, be careful from getting it too dark or you may have burnt it</li>
            <li> Once your sugar is caramelized, add in your marinated pork with all of the ingrients and juices along with it </li>
            <li> Pan fry pork for about 30 seconds to release aroma from shallots and garlic </li>
            <li> Add your coconut soda or coconut water, and allow to simmer on medium heat for 40 mins</li>
            <li> After 40 mins, add your boiled eggs into the pot and continue to simmer uncovered for another 30 minutes </li>
            <li> OPTIONAL - Garnish with red chilies, if you like spice, ground black pepper, and green onions </li>
            <li> Voila! Serve this dish over a warm bowl of white or jasmie rice and enjoy! </li>
        </ol>
